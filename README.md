# Pulsar_star_prediction








This project aims to classify pulsar stars from a dataset . We have leveraged random forest classifier model to do the prediction task  


The dataset used in this project is HTRU2 , which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey .

Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter .

As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes. For making the prediction we have made use of the following features .

Mean of the integrated profile.
Standard deviation of the integrated profile.
Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.
Skewness of the integrated profile.
Mean of the DM-SNR curve.
Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve.
Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve.
Skewness of the DM-SNR curve.
